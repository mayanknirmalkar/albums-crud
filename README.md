# React Albums CRUD App

This React application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app that interacts with the JSONPlaceholder API to manage albums. The app allows you to fetch and display albums from the provided API, add a new album, update an existing album, and delete an album.

## Features

### Fetch and Show Albums:

- Fetches albums data from the [JSONPlaceholder Albums API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).
- Displays the fetched albums in the user interface.

### Add an Album:

- Performs a dummy POST request to the [JSONPlaceholder Albums API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) to simulate adding a new album.
- Saves the dummy album data in the React state.

### Update an Album:

- Performs a dummy PUT request to the [JSONPlaceholder Albums API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) to simulate updating an existing album.
- Reflects the changes in the React state.

### Delete an Album:

- Performs a dummy DELETE request to the [JSONPlaceholder Albums API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) to simulate deleting an album.
- Updates the React state to reflect the removal of the album.
